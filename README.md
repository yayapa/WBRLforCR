The code of Whole-body Representation Learning Improves Competing Preclinical Disease Risk Assessment. The paper proposes the use of RL for the preclinical risk assessment under the competing risk modeling. Evaluated on the whole-body organ (CVD, T2D, COPD, CKD) and cardiac (IHD, HD, stroke) datasets.

This repository includes two other repositories:
## CompetingRisk
Based on the code from the [NeuralFG repository](https://github.com/Jeanselme/NeuralFineGray) adapted to use embeddings and radiomics features.
Note: the data csv files are removed due to the privacy reasons.

## WholebodyRL
Based on the code from [Whole Heart RL](https://github.com/Yundi-Zhang/WholeHeartRL).
